# Preventing IPv6 Leaks
IPv6 Leaks are prevented by default to increase security.
Tunnels prevents IPv6 leaks using a catch-all IPv6 route.

Optional IPv6 block can be enabled here:
 1. go to `tunnels`
 2. select `edit` from the right hand side menu
 3. scroll down until you see `PreventIPv6` and uncheck it
 4. click save

WARNING: if you enable this tunnels won't connect if IPv6 is enabled on your system.
